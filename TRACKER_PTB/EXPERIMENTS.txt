EXPERIMENTS ===============================================================

CALIBRATION
>> Bars that changes orientation against a noise background
>> Used to calibrate eye position
>> Well timed hand response is rewarded

CHOICE_SACCADE
>> Present targets
>> Targets selected with eye movement
>> Reward based on selection and target

Curve_Tracing
>> Curve tracing experiments
>> Lever responses
>> Training possibilities

FIGURE_GROUND
>> Figure ground experiments
>> fixation or lever task
>> different stimulus types

HRF-checker
>> Flashed checkerboards to estimate individual HRF

INITIAL_TRAINING
>> same as REPORT_FIXORIENTCHANGE ?

INITIAL_TRAINING_FIX
>> ???

REPORT_FIXORIENTCHANGE
>> Bars that changes orientation against a noise background
>> more extensive version of CALIBRATION

RETINOTOPY
>> Different retinotopic mapping stimuli
>> checkerboard/faces/walkers rings and wedges
>> prf moving bars in 8 directions
>> with or without hand response task 
>> if wthout task, fixation is rewarded
>> some checkerboards are set up to get individual HRFs
